# SpringDemo
This is a repository created to demonstrate my newly learnt skill: Spring.
Employee details are stored as objects which are populated through XML configurations.
I have learnt the following concepts while building this example:

1. Spring Modules
2. IoC Container
3. Dependency Injection

Wrote the Employee and Address (bean) classes first and then use the XML file(meta date) to populate the attributes of objects of address and 
Employee classes.(IOC container: BeanFactory or  ApplicationContext))
Next, I added the external jars for spring framework.
And then ran them.
The Dependency Injection concept was included in dealing with the dependency between Address and Employee classes.
Every employee has an Address.
